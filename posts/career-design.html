          <div class="article-content">
            <p>In <a href="'https://designingyour.life'">Designing Your Life</a>, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans suggest that four important factors of our life satisfaction are our health, leisure activities, relationships and <strong>career</strong>. The premise of “life design” is that we should be intentional about them all. In this post, I’ve summarized some takeaways from the book about career design.</p>

<h1 id="foundational-mindsets">Foundational Mindsets</h1>

<p><strong>Bias to action</strong> is the commitment to building your way forward as opposed to sitting and thinking. We must reject the idea that we have to first find what we’re passionate before getting out hands dirty.</p>

<p><strong>Asking for help</strong> means that radical collaboration is the only way that design problems can be solved. The iPhone could not have been designed by an individual.</p>

<h1 id="starting-the-process">Starting the Process</h1>

<p><strong>Strive for coherency</strong> where who you are, what you believe, and what you are doing line up. We might not know where we’re going but we can check whether we are going in the right direction based on how we answer questions about our “workview” and “lifeview.”</p>

<h3 id="workview-questions">Workview Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What’s work for?</li>
  <li>How does it relate to the individual, others, society?</li>
  <li>What defines good or worthwhile work?- What does money have to do with it?</li>
  <li>What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with it?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lifeview-questions">Lifeview Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Why are we here?</li>
  <li>What is the meaning or purpose of life?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship between the individual and others?</li>
  <li>Where do family, country, and the rest of the world fit in?</li>
  <li>What is good, and what is evil?</li>
  <li>Is there a higher power, God, or something transcendent, and if so, what impact does this have on your life?</li>
  <li>What is the role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workview-and-lifeview-integration">Workview and Lifeview Integration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Where do your views on work and life complement one another?</li>
  <li>Where do they clash?</li>
  <li>Does one drive the other? How?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="wayfinding">Wayfinding</h1>

<p>“… the ancient art of figuring out where you are going when you don’t actually know your destination. For wayfinding, you need a compass and you need a direction. Not a map—a direction.”</p>

<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>

<p>To check if we’re going in the right directions there two clues, the first of which is engagement. The highest form of engagement is called flow. First described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <strong>flow is a state where you’re totally immersed in what you’re doing</strong> because the difficulty level matches up with your skills in a sweet spot that is neither too easy nor too hard. It brings a feeling of euphoria, clarity, and stillness of time.</p>

<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>

<p>The second clue is energy. Some activities <strong>sustain our energy</strong> while others drain it. Being mindful of this in addition to engagement can help us to reach fulfillment in work. A good example of an energizing activity that combines engaging and energizing effects on me would be exercising.</p>

<h1 id="energy-and-engagement-reflection">Energy and engagement reflection</h1>

<p>Having kept track of some activities from the past, the <strong>AEIOU breakdown</strong> helps us to dive deeper into what about the activity contributed to higher energy and engagement.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Activities</td>
      <td>Structured vs unstructured? Observer or participant?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Environments</td>
      <td>What kind of a place and how did it make you feel?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interactions</td>
      <td>With people or machines? New vs familiar? Formal or informal?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Objects</td>
      <td>What were the objects that created or supported your feeling engaged?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Users</td>
      <td>Who else was there, and what role did they play in making it either a positive or a negative experience?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h1 id="design-your-lives">Design Your Lives</h1>

<p>Rather than choosing the best possible life, acknowledge there are multiple great lives and build forward on a promising one. Instead of having Plan A, B and C, have three life designs that could all good adventures and choose the next one based on available resources. Choose your adventure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Doing the thing you have in mind</li>
  <li>The thing you’d do if the thing you have in mind were suddenly no longer an option</li>
  <li>The thing you’d do if money or image were no object</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-get-a-job">How To Get A Job</h1>

<p>In my post, <a href="'ob/posts/calculating-the-odds-of-job-application-callbacks'">Calculating the Odds of Job Application Callbacks</a>, I calculated that using internet to find a job could require at least 200 applications. The odds are stacked against applicants. If you do decide to mine the internet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to get pass keyword filters</li>
  <li>Be precise and craft an exact fit (exclude everything un-related)</li>
  <li>Re-write résumé with the exact wording in the job posting</li>
  <li>Focus on the hiring manager’s need to find the right person</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="red-flags">Red flags</h3>

<p>In a good labor market a job post should only be up for a month at most. Learn to translate HR-speak in the job description and skills requirements. Look out for anything in the description that suggests the job is impossible. Sometimes companies already “hired” someone but they cook up a description to match the person and post it to get around corporate bureaucracy.</p>

<h1 id="designing-your-dream-job">Designing Your Dream Job</h1>

<p>Your dream job doesn’t exist. You have to seek and co-create it. Rather than relying on research, try to build “prototype experiences.” These are low cost ways to try out your options such as by starting a small business in the role you want or doing an internship.</p>

<p>Most jobs are not posted on the internet so the best technique to find a job is to learn what kind of work you might want to do. Conduct fifty interviews with people in the industry and ask: “what steps would be involved in exploring how someone like me might become a part of this organization?” It’s important to understand networking as simply asking for directions.</p>

<h1 id="choosing-happiness">Choosing Happiness</h1>

<p>We tend to agonize over our choices. Instead we should gather and create lots of options, narrow them down, choose one and then let go &amp; move on. If you find yourself agonizing, let go by directing your attention on something positive.</p>

<h1 id="failure-immunity">Failure Immunity</h1>

<p>When you build your way forward with prototypes, you will inevitably fail. We have to take these as learning lessons by keeping track of failures, categorizing them (<strong>screwups, weaknesses, growth opportunities</strong>) then identifying insights.</p>

<h1 id="community">Community</h1>

<p>Life design is a communal effort. We need supporters, interlocutors, and intimates to help brainstorm and review ideas. Also, it’s nice to have a good mentor who can use their life experience to bring objectivity to your situation and helps to reframe issues in ways you may not have thought about. A community are marked by a kindred purpose and shared ground, they meet regularly, and are involved in each other’s lives.</p>
